# PhotoAlbumAPI
An example WebAPI to combine Photos with the albums they come from

The task was to create an API which would combine the calls from the following APIs:
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums

http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos

It also had to allow filtering based on the userID of the Albums.
